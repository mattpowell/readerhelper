Code behind the site at readerhelper.com. Originally started as a see-how-fast-I-could-create-a-solution-to-my-problem type of project, then became a how-fast-can-I-put-this-on-the-internet type of project, and finally it became a lets-check-out-this-pagoda-box-thing-,-oh-it-needs-to-be-on-github project. Either case, that's what this is doing here. Feel free to send ?'s, fork, or whatev's.
